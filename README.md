# Transposer: Zero-Shot Semantic Generalization via Transposition

> A novel neural architecture that reveals semantic relationships without training, without attention, and without large-scale data — built using NumPy and pure algebraic transformations.

---

##  Abstract

**Transposer** is a zero-training, algebraically defined neural architecture that performs semantic generalization from raw text using transposition and projection of embedding spaces. Unlike conventional transformer models that rely on attention mechanisms and large-scale gradient-based training, Transposer directly projects meaning through latent dimensional interactions.

This model can extract meaningful relationships such as “education → learning” from as few as 3 sentences — without pretraining, fine-tuning, or any learned parameters.

##  Key Features

- ✅ No training or optimization required  
- ✅ No attention mechanism, softmax, or transformer layers  
- ✅ Runs on CPUs (tested on 2 GB RAM with no GPU)  
- ✅ Generalizes from raw embeddings  
- ✅ Built entirely using NumPy and first-principles matrix operations  
- ✅ Produces LLM-like relational outputs with zero-shot data

##  Architecture Overview

The Transposer model applies:

1. **Initial embedding + optional positional encoding**
2. **Matrix transposition over embedding dimensions**
3. **Linear transformation (W₁ → ReLU → W₂)**
4. **Residual connection to input embedding**
5. **Cosine similarity field probing**

This results in a transformed embedding space that retains and amplifies latent semantic structure.

## Example Input

### `data.txt`

```text
The contamination of Earth's ecosystems has increased...
```

---

## Run the Model

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python transposer.py
```

---

## Output Example

```
--- Language Understanding Test ---

Related words to 'individuals': ['respiratory', 'greed', 'disrupting']
Related words to 'corporations': ['future', 'activities', 'adopt']
```

## Applications

Rapid semantic inference on low-resource systems

AI research on field-based generalization

Educational tools for low-compute environments

Prototyping ultra-lightweight AGI-style learners



---

## Research Significance

Transposer demonstrates that:

> "Semantic generalization does not require parameter learning — it can emerge from latent field transformations."



This suggests a new class of neural architectures:
Semantic Field Encoders, designed not for scale but for structure.
