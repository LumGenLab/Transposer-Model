# Transposer-Model
# Transposer 🧠✨

**Transposition-Enhanced Representation Learning**  
*A lightweight architecture beyond attention, created by Abd, powered by matrix algebra and semantic intuition.*

## 🌟 What is Transposer?

Transposer is a novel neural architecture that learns semantic relationships between words **without any training**, **without GPUs**, and using **only NumPy**. It was inspired by matrix transposition from a 9th-grade mathematics textbook and runs in just ~23 seconds on a 2GB RAM machine.

> “While others require 100 billion tokens, Transposer generalizes from 3 lines.”
